        “I can’t believe this is actually good for me!”

- I shouted out after my first cup of The Good Stuff FOCUS...


———————————
If you're anything like me, you understand the sheer joy of that perfect cup of morning coffee, complete with a generous scoop of sugar and cream.

The aroma fills the air, that first sip tantalizes your taste buds, and a warm rush of satisfaction washes over you. 

It's a routine we can all relate to, isn't it?

Now, when it comes to creamers, my weakness has always been those with a cocoa or chocolate flavor. 

It takes that already divine experience and elevates it to new heights of indulgence.

    <section class="s-003-text">

        But here's the catch—I've always felt a twinge of guilt
when giving in to my sweet tooth and adding those
extra scoops of cream and sugar to my coffee...

        Deep down, I knew it wasn't the healthiest choice, yet I found myself doing it almost every morning

———————————


About a year ago, as I glanced at the scale, I realized it was time for a major change. 

Despite considering myself fairly healthy, working out three times a week and making smarter food choices like opting for sweet potato fries over regular ones, I still couldn't shake off that stubborn belly fat and flabby arms. 

It puzzled me.

How could I be putting in the effort to stay healthy but still struggle with 20-30 pounds of excess weight?

———————————


For as long as I can remember, my routine involved jogging to Starbucks in Naperville each morning, treating myself to either a grande Java Chip Frappuccino or a Venti Cafe Mocha as a reward for completing my run. 

I always assumed these drinks were relatively healthy, no different from the coffee I made at home with cream and sugar.

That illusion shattered when I stumbled upon a Facebook post from one of my fit friends, exposing the alarming sugar content in Starbucks drinks.

Naturally, I was skeptical at first, but curiosity got the better of me. I visited Starbucks' website, and there it was—the nutrition label, revealing a shocking truth.

        I'm no nutritionist or personal trainer, but even I could see the red flags: nearly 60 grams of sugar, over 400 calories per drink, and a laundry list of unrecognizable ingredients like Xanthan Gum, Palm Kernel Oil, and Processed Alkali.

It was a wake-up call.

I realized my health was gradually deteriorating, and there was a reason I couldn't shed that stubborn belly fat, or as I affectionately called it, my built-in flotation device.
———————————


But it wasn't just the weight gain—I began noticing
random bumps and wrinkles on my skin, and my hair
seemed to be thinning by the month.
———————————


Aging, I thought, until I considered the possibility that there might be more to it.

Refusing to accept my fate of carrying around those extra pounds and experiencing premature aging, I embarked on a mission to find a solution. 

I scoured the internet for a way to maintain my beloved chocolate coffee morning routine without compromising two things:

After days of intensive research, 
I stumbled upon a unique product
called "The Good Stuff FOCUS"


Created by none other than professional golfer Phil Mickelson and his long-term friend and elite performance coach, Dave Phillips. 

It promised to be a healthy alternative to the additional 500 calories
I was consuming each morning in my coffee.

Curiosity piqued, I decided to take the plunge and ordered a 
bag—and let me tell you,

I haven't looked back since.

        Hey there, I'm Phil Mickelson
        <img src=""/ alt="test.png">

If you're a fan of professional golf, chances are you've heard my name before.

But for those who don't know me, let me introduce myself.

I've dedicated most of my life to playing golf at the highest level, constantly striving for greatness and pushing my limits.

Throughout my journey, I've accomplished some incredible feats with the help of hard work and an incredible support system.

I take pride in being a three-time Masters tournament champion, along with clinching victory in 42 other major PGA Tour events, including being the oldest winner of the PGA Championship at the age of 51 in 2021.

Of course, there have been moments of near-misses and runner-ups, but that's all part of the game.

However, there's more to my story than golf championships.

        I've undergone a personal transformation
that has had a profound impact on my life

It all started with a realization that I needed to take accountability for my own health if
I wanted any chance at longevity in my golf career.

This sparked my desire to share my journey and help others unlock their full potential.

And that's how For Wellness came to be—a company with a mission to ignite holistic improvement, not just in performance, but in overall well-being.
